# Final-Bank-Customer
 This is the repository for a final project of CIST 2342 at Chattahoochee Technical College

This project was mostly a back-end project that was made as win-form application. The UI is very crude and basic but functional

The application starts by prompting the user to login. The user will not be able to login if the user id does not match the password in the DB.

After login the user will land on the account view page. On this page the user is prompted to enter account number. With the account number an account will be displayed on the right; however, if the enters an account number not connected to the account the application will not display that account and will notify the user.

On the same page the user can also create a new account. The user will be prompted to select the type of account and the initial deposit. The account number will be selected automatically.

At the bottom of the account view page the user will be able to find the deposit/withdraw button. This button will take the user to a form where they can deposit and withdraw from their accounts.

On this page the user will be able to select if they will be withdrawing from an account or depositing into an account. They will enter the account number and the amount. Then the change will be made in the DB with the provided information.

After the changes have been made the user can then return to account view page with the back button. They can then view the new account with the updated balance after their deposit or withdraw.
